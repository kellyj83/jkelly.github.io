### Applying Stochastic Processes to Financial Modelling

In this short project, I create a short HTML Document that explains how you can apply Stochastic Calculus (Geometric Brownian Motion, OU Process) to predict trends for Index Funds

### Final Year Thesis: Finite Element Method for Differential Equations

In my undergraduate thesis, I explored the **Finite Element Method (FEM)** for solving 1D and 2D differential equations like the **Laplace Equation** and **Heat Equation**, along with **Elliptic PDEs**. Using **MATLAB**, I developed programs to solve these equations with **numerical quadrature**, applying the method to the **Black-Scholes equation** for pricing European Call/Put options.
