### Applying Stochastic Processes to Financial Modelling

In this short project, I create a short HTML Document that explains how you can apply Stochastic Calculus (Geometric Brownian Motion, OU Process) to predict trends for Index Funds

### Final Year Thesis: Finite Element Method for Differential Equations

In my undergraduate thesis, I investigated the **Finite Element Method (FEM)** for solving 1D and 2D **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**, such as the Poisson Equation, Heat Equation, and Elliptic PDEs. Using MATLAB, I implemented FEM with numerical quadrature and applied it to the **Black-Scholes equation** for pricing European call and put options, focusing on accuracy and error analysis.
